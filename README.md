# Media Trailer Site

The project consists in a server side code to store a list of your favourite movies and TV Shows, including some useful
information for Movies and TVShows like Title, posters, and trailers.
The Main.py file will generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies, tv shows and watch the trailers.

## Why this project?

This project was develop as Final Project for the course <i>"Programming Foundations with Python"</i> for the <i>Full Stack Web 
Developer nanodegree (UDACITY)</i>.

## Project code detail

The project consists in the following modules:

<ul>
  <li>main.py</li>
  <li>render_page.py</li>
  <li>content.py</li>
  <li>media.py</li>

the web page.

The project was developed using Python 2.7.12.

<ol>
  <li>Install Python 2.7.12 </li>
  <li>Edit the main.py file to add, edit or remove media objects.</li>
  <li>Run the main.py file</li>
</ol>

## Expected results

The project will be interpreted by the Python interpreter and when the parser finish the program will open a new browser tab
with the web page.

## Known issues
<ol>
  <li>The search option is not implemented yet.</li>
